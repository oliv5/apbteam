/* A C-program for TT800 : July 8th 1996 Version 
   by M. Matsumoto, email: m-mat @ math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp

   Modified for AVR modules by Nicolas Schodet.

   genrand() generate one pseudorandom number with double precision
   which is uniformly distributed on [0,1]-interval
   for each call.  One may choose any initial 25 seeds
   except all zeros.
