// can not have children. If an actual number of children reaches a parameter's
// value, the node will have not been able to accept any more children joining the
// network. The parameter can be set to 0 on a router thus preventing it from

//  While joining the network the node receives beacon responses from potential
// parents containing their actual network depth and declines those which show

// potential parent will also reject a beacon from the joining device and will not
// sent a response if the joining device shows the network depth greater than it is
// allowed on the potential parent. This logic is enabled if the parameter value is
// not greater than 15. If its value is greater than 15, then device does not

// devices across considerable distances.

// automatically during route discovery. An entry is added when a route is
// discovered.

// the ZDO_SetTxPowerReq() function.
// 
//  Value range: depends on the hardware. Transmit power must be in the range from

  Parameters that affect data transfer:

  APP_TRANSMISSION_DELAY, ms
    Delay beetween transmitted packets.

    A value of 0 means no dealy is needed.

  APP_MAX_PACKET_SIZE, bytes
    Maximum amount of useful data that will be sent in one packet

  APP_DELAY_BEFORE_SEND, ms
    Delay beetween reception of first byte of current packet from UART and
